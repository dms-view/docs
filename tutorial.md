# Goal
The goal of <a href="https://dms-view.github.io" target="_blank">`dms_view`</a> is to facilitate the analysis of deep [mutational scanning experiments](/docs/dms) through interactive visualizations.
<a href="https://dms-view.github.io" target="_blank">`dms_view`</a> links together three pieces of information: a site-level summary metric, a mutation-level metric, and the 3-D protein structure.

This tutorial consists of two sections
1. [Introduction to the tool and its features](#introduction)
2. [Sample analysis with Influenza Virus data](#sample-analysis)

# Introduction

## Layout

<a href="https://dms-view.github.io" target="_blank">`dms_view`</a> is broken into two sections: the data section and the description section.

The data section at the top of the page has three panels: the site panel, the mutation panel, and the protein structure panel.
The site panel dot plot shows a summary value for each site in the experiment.
When sites are selected, the individual mutation values are shown in the the mutation panel logoplot and the site is highlighted on the protein structure.
You can change the data file or protein structure using the URL form fields above the panels.

The description section is at the bottom of the page.
This flexible section can be used to hold information about the experiment, give credit to those who generated the data, or hold notes about a particular analysis.
You can change the information using the URL form field above the section.

For more information on the data format for the data file, the protein structure, or the description file, please see the [data upload](/docs/dataupload) page.

## How you select sites
The goal of <a href="https://dms-view.github.io" target="_blank">`dms_view`</a> is to link site-level, mutation-level, and protein-structure information from a deep mutational scan.
When a site is selected on the site plot, its mutation-level information is shown below as a logoplot and it is highlighted on the protein structure.

### Selecting sites
There are three ways to select a site in the site plot: clicking a site, brushing a site(s), or listing a specific site(s) by its label.

1. Clicking on a site: You can click on a site using the mouse. Clicking on the site again will deselect the site.
2. Brushing a site(s): You can brush several sites at once by clicking, holding, and swiping the mouse. Sites within the brush box will be selected.
3. Listing a site(s): You can select a site by adding it to the selected site form field. This form field will also be updated with sites selected by clicking or brushing. The selected site field is a comma-separated list without leading or trailing spaces.

### Deselecting sites
There are four ways to deselect a site in the site plot: clicking on a site, brushing a site(s), removing a site(s) from the selected site form field, or clicking the clear selections button.

1. Clicking on a site: You can click on a site using the mouse.
2. Brushing a site(s): You can brush several sites at once to deselect them by holding the shift key and clicking, holding, and swiping the mouse. Sites within the brush box will be deselected. You can also use the radio buttons to toggle between the select and deselect brush instead of the shift-key shortcut.
3. Removing a site(s) from the selected site field: You can deselect a site by removing it from the selected site form field. The selected site field is a comma-separated list without leading or trailing spaces.
4. Clicking on the clear selections button: You can clear _all_ selected sites by clicking the clear selections button.

### Navigation

There are two features to help you find a specific site in the site plot: site-plot tooltip and zoom bar.

1. site-plot tooltip: You can hover over a site in the site plot and a tooltip will show some information about the site such as the label, the site-metric value, and the wildtype.
2. zoom bar: You can zoom into a specific area of the site-plot using the zoom bar. If you brush (click, hold, and swipe) the zoom bar, the site-plot will zoom to the x-axis coordinates selected on the zoom bar.

### What happens when you select a site

When a site is selected it is highlighted on the site plot, the protein structure and additional measurements are shown in the mutation plot.

The selected sites are colored the same on the protein structure and in the line plot.
This color corresponds to the value of site-level metric.
You can hover over the sites on the site plot or the protein structure to see a tooltip with more information about the site.

The mutation plot shows additional measurements at the selected site as a logoplot.
In a typical [deep mutational scanning](/docs/dms) experiment, multiple genetic variants are assayed at each site and the logoplot shows the effect of each amino acid at each site in the protein.

## Dropdown menus

You can toggle between different datasets, different metrics, and different protein representations using the different dropdown menus.

### Metric dropdowns

There is a dropdown menu for the site plot and the mutation plot to toggle between different metrics.
These menus are autofilled based on the input data.
For more information on the input data format, please see the [data upload](/docs/dataupload) page.

### Condition dropdown

Changing the condition dropdown changes the data that is shown in both the site plot and the mutation plot.
For a typical [deep mutational scanning](/docs/dms) experiment, these conditions would be different selection pressures.
This menu is also autofilled based on the input data.
For more information on the input data format, please see the [data upload](/docs/dataupload) page.

### Protein dropdown

You can toggle between different representations of the protein structure (cartoon, surface, etc) using the protein panel dropdown menu.

## Sharing a state

<a href="https://dms-view.github.io" target="_blank">`dms_view`</a> tracks the state (the combination of data, dropdown menu selections and selected sites) in the URL.
If after exploring a dataset you find a view that you want to save or share with someone else, you simply need to copy the URL.
As an example, here are two different views of the same dataset with slightly different selections: <a href="https://dms-view.github.io/?markdown-url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fdms-view%2Fdms-view.github.io%2Fmaster%2Flee2019mapping.md&data-url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fdms-view%2Fdms-view.github.io%2Fmaster%2Fdata%2FIAV%2Fflu_dms-view.csv&condition=2010-age-21&site_metric=site_Positive+Differential+Selection&mutation_metric=mut_Differential+Selection&selected_sites=144%2C157%2C159%2C160%2C189%2C193%2C222%2C224&pdb-url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fdms-view%2Fdms-view.github.io%2Fmaster%2F4O5N_trimer.pdb" target="_blank">view #1</a> and <a href="https://dms-view.github.io/?markdown-url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fdms-view%2Fdms-view.github.io%2Fmaster%2Flee2019mapping.md&data-url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fdms-view%2Fdms-view.github.io%2Fmaster%2Fdata%2FIAV%2Fflu_dms-view.csv&condition=2009-age-53&site_metric=site_Positive+Differential+Selection&mutation_metric=mut_Differential+Selection&selected_sites=144%2C157%2C159%2C160%2C189%2C193%2C222%2C224&pdb-url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fdms-view%2Fdms-view.github.io%2Fmaster%2F4O5N_trimer.pdb" target="_blank">view #2</a>

## Saving images

You can save the current view of a panel by clicking the **Download SVG** or **download PNG** button.
This button will download an SVG or PNG of that panel only, not of the whole tool.

## Adding your own data to the site

<a href="https://dms-view.github.io" target="_blank">`dms_view`</a> uses three different files: the data file, the protein structure file, and the description file.
You can upload your data using each file's specific form field. Please see the [data upload](/docs/dataupload) page for specifics on the file formats for each file.

<a href="https://dms-view.github.io" target="_blank">`dms_view`</a> does not host the data itself, the files must be hosted on some other server such as [GitHub](https://www.github.com), [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com), or [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/).

# Sample analysis

Here we will walk through a simple analysis of Influenza Virus data using <a href="https://dms-view.github.io" target="_blank">`dms_view`</a>.

### Experimental setup

[Lee _et al_., 2019](https://elifesciences.org/articles/49324) assayed the ability of every single amino-acid change in an Influenza Virus protein on its ability to abrogate binding to antibodies in human sera.

We can compare sera from different people to see individual differences in Influenza Virus immunity.

### Set up Analysis with [`dms-view`](jbloomlab.github.io/dms-view)

As mentioned above, <a href="https://dms-view.github.io" target="_blank">`dms_view`</a> takes up to three files: the data file with the deep mutational scanning measurements, the protein structure file, and the description file.
We followed the [data upload](/docs/dataupload) guidelines and created a [data file](https://github.com/jbloomlab/dms-view/blob/master/docs/_data/IAV/flu_dms-view.csv), a [description file](https://github.com/jbloomlab/dms-view/blob/master/docs/_data/IAV/lee2019mapping.md), and retrieved a [protein structure](https://github.com/jbloomlab/dms-view/blob/master/docs/_data/IAV/4O5N_trimer.pdb) for this experiment.

The conditions in this experiment are the sera from different individuals.

### Analysis with [`dms-view`](jbloomlab.github.io/dms-view)

Here are three questions we might want to ask of this dataset.

### (1) Are the sites most highly selected for the same between two different sera?

To answer this question, we first need to select sites of interest for one patient's sera (<a href="https://dms-view.github.io/?markdown-url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fdms-view%2Fdms-view.github.io%2Fmaster%2Flee2019mapping.md&pdb-url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fdms-view%2Fdms-view.github.io%2Fmaster%2F4O5N_trimer.pdb&data-url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fdms-view%2Fdms-view.github.io%2Fmaster%2Fdata%2FIAV%2Fflu_dms-view.csv&condition=2010-age-21&site_metric=site_Positive+Differential+Selection&mutation_metric=mut_Differential+Selection&selected_sites=144%2C159%2C193%2C222%2C244" target="_blank">'2010-age-21' sera top sites</a>) and then change the condition dropdown to a new patient (<a href="https://dms-view.github.io/?markdown-url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fdms-view%2Fdms-view.github.io%2Fmaster%2Flee2019mapping.md&pdb-url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fdms-view%2Fdms-view.github.io%2Fmaster%2F4O5N_trimer.pdb&data-url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fdms-view%2Fdms-view.github.io%2Fmaster%2Fdata%2FIAV%2Fflu_dms-view.csv&condition=2009-age-53&site_metric=site_Positive+Differential+Selection&mutation_metric=mut_Differential+Selection&selected_sites=144%2C159%2C193%2C222%2C244" target="_blank">'2009-age-53' sera with '2010-age-21' top sites</a>).
By comparing these two views, we can see that there is no overlap in top sites between these two patient's sera.
Of course, you don't need two separate links, you can toggle the condition dropdown menu yourself.

### (2) If top sites are shared between patients, are the same amino-acid mutations important between the patients?

To answer this question, we need to find a pair of sera that share a top site and compare their mutation plots.
<a href="https://dms-view.github.io/?markdown-url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fdms-view%2Fdms-view.github.io%2Fmaster%2Flee2019mapping.md&pdb-url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fdms-view%2Fdms-view.github.io%2Fmaster%2F4O5N_trimer.pdb&data-url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fdms-view%2Fdms-view.github.io%2Fmaster%2Fdata%2FIAV%2Fflu_dms-view.csv&condition=2009-age-64&site_metric=site_Positive+Differential+Selection&mutation_metric=mut_Differential+Selection&selected_sites=159" target="_blank">'2009-age-64'</a> and <a href="https://dms-view.github.io/?markdown-url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fdms-view%2Fdms-view.github.io%2Fmaster%2Flee2019mapping.md&pdb-url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fdms-view%2Fdms-view.github.io%2Fmaster%2F4O5N_trimer.pdb&data-url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fdms-view%2Fdms-view.github.io%2Fmaster%2Fdata%2FIAV%2Fflu_dms-view.csv&condition=2009-age-65&site_metric=site_Positive+Differential+Selection&mutation_metric=mut_Differential+Selection&selected_sites=159" target="_blank">'2009-age-65'</a> both selected site 159 strongly.
By comparing these two views, we can see that while the overall stacks may differ, the amino acid with the largest effect is Glycine (G) in both conditions.

### (3) Which regions of the protein structure are targeted by influenza immunity?

To answer this question, we need to select the top sites for each sera (<a href="https://dms-view.github.io/?markdown-url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fdms-view%2Fdms-view.github.io%2Fmaster%2Flee2019mapping.md&pdb-url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fdms-view%2Fdms-view.github.io%2Fmaster%2F4O5N_trimer.pdb&data-url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fdms-view%2Fdms-view.github.io%2Fmaster%2Fdata%2FIAV%2Fflu_dms-view.csv&condition=2010-age-21&site_metric=site_Positive+Differential+Selection&mutation_metric=mut_Differential+Selection&selected_sites=144%2C159%2C193%2C222" target="_blank">'2010-age-21'</a>, <a href="https://dms-view.github.io/?markdown-url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fdms-view%2Fdms-view.github.io%2Fmaster%2Flee2019mapping.md&pdb-url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fdms-view%2Fdms-view.github.io%2Fmaster%2F4O5N_trimer.pdb&data-url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fdms-view%2Fdms-view.github.io%2Fmaster%2Fdata%2FIAV%2Fflu_dms-view.csv&condition=2009-age-53&site_metric=site_Positive+Differential+Selection&mutation_metric=mut_Differential+Selection&selected_sites=157%2C160" target="_blank">'2009-age-53'</a>, <a href="https://dms-view.github.io/?markdown-url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fdms-view%2Fdms-view.github.io%2Fmaster%2Flee2019mapping.md&pdb-url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fdms-view%2Fdms-view.github.io%2Fmaster%2F4O5N_trimer.pdb&data-url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fdms-view%2Fdms-view.github.io%2Fmaster%2Fdata%2FIAV%2Fflu_dms-view.csv&condition=2009-age-64&site_metric=site_Positive+Differential+Selection&mutation_metric=mut_Differential+Selection&selected_sites=159%2C222%2C244" target="_blank">'2009-age-64'</a>, and <a href="https://dms-view.github.io/?markdown-url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fdms-view%2Fdms-view.github.io%2Fmaster%2Flee2019mapping.md&pdb-url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fdms-view%2Fdms-view.github.io%2Fmaster%2F4O5N_trimer.pdb&data-url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fdms-view%2Fdms-view.github.io%2Fmaster%2Fdata%2FIAV%2Fflu_dms-view.csv&condition=2009-age-65&site_metric=site_Positive+Differential+Selection&mutation_metric=mut_Differential+Selection&selected_sites=159%2C160%2C193" target="_blank">'2009-age-65'</a>) and see where they fall on the protein structure.
By comparing the different views, we can see that even though the sites are not exactly the same, they all target the "head" of the protein.
